    <div class="aboutText"><h1>About Me-laxander:</h1>
 <p>I have been playing music since the age of 11, starting with the drums. In the ninth grade, I moved to 
   electric bass and quickly got interested in the guitar. I started streaming on twitch in late 2019 as a casual
    game streamer. After making pals with a music streamer I realized that that was what I ought to be 
    pursuing, and I’ve done so since April 2020. I love to talk about guitar based music, playing and technique, 
    theory, metal subgenres, bands and more. I have Type 1 Diabetes and am super happy to explain that part of my lifestyle. 
    I have done fundraising streams for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and always look forward to doing more work with them.
    I’ve had Type 1 Diabetes for 11 years and playing the role of advocate is a joy for me. </p>
